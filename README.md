## 📁 About the Project

Loan default is a major concern for banks and financial institutions. Using customer data such as demographics, income, loan amount, and credit history, we explore the dataset and build predictive models to determine the probability of loan default.

### Objectives:
- Analyze patterns and trends in loan applicant data.
- Identify key factors contributing to loan default.
- Build a machine learning model to predict loan default.
